# G-Code Assembler

A web tool that turns G-code into a watertight STL: upload a `.gcode` file, get a real-time 3D preview and a mesh you can download.

Built in 36-ish hours at MakeUC 2024 (November 2024). Winner — Kinetic Vision Challenge (3D Printing / 3D Modeling).

## What it does

Most slicers go the other direction: mesh in, G-code out. This goes backwards. You give it a `.gcode` file — the actual toolpath a printer would run — and it reconstructs a solid mesh from the extrusion moves, then lets you spin it around in the browser before you download it.

The motivating case is the Kinetic Vision challenge itself: you're handed G-code and need to get back a model you can inspect and modify, without a printer on hand to just run it and look.

There's also a path that skips the browser entirely: a Jupyter notebook that runs the same G-code-to-STL pipeline for people who just want the file.

## How it works

- `Backend/flask_back.py` is the whole backend. A `GcodeReader` class parses FDM G-code line by line, tracking absolute/relative extrusion mode, and turns each extruding move into a line segment tagged with its layer and a segment id.
- Each segment becomes a rectangular prism (width x height x length) with 8 vertices and 12 triangular faces, extruded along the toolpath — that's the watertight mesh, written out with `numpy-stl`.
- `STLAutoAnalyzer` reads a generated STL back and infers print parameters from the geometry alone: layer height from the spacing between Z levels, extrusion width from horizontal edge lengths, build direction, volume, surface area, and per-layer triangle/area stats.
- Flask exposes three endpoints: `POST /api/upload-gcode` (parse and mesh), `GET /api/stl-file` (download the result), `GET /api/model-data` (the analyzer's report, for the UI).
- `gcode-viewer/` is the React front end — `react-router` for an upload page and a viewer page, `@react-three/fiber` and `three.js` for the interactive STL preview.
- `Backend/test.ipynb` runs the same `GcodeReader` → STL pipeline outside the web app, for generating files directly.

## Run locally

The browser and Flask server run separately. From the repository root, install the Python dependencies and start the backend:

```sh
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python Backend/flask_back.py
```

In another terminal, start the React frontend:

```sh
cd gcode-viewer
npm install
npm start
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`. The frontend is configured to call the Flask server at `http://localhost:5001`. This is a local prototype; it processes one current model in the server process at a time and only the backend's regular FDM G-code mode is implemented.

## Prototype

A standalone script that shows the two ideas the real backend relies on — segments grouped by layer, and each segment carrying an extrusion length that maps to print time — on a toy square-spiral toolpath instead of a real upload. Illustrative only, not the production parser.

The diagram script needs Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib. Run from the repository root:

```sh
python -m pip install numpy matplotlib
python prototype/gcode_prototype.py
```

It writes the two diagrams to `prototype/figures/`. The script generates a 7-layer inward square spiral, colors each layer's path (folding back to a 4-color palette past layer 4), and estimates per-layer print time from segment length at a constant feedrate.
